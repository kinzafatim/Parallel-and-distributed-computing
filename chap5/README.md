# Chapter 5: Asynchronous Programming

This chapter explores asynchronous programming using Python’s asyncio library and concurrency using the concurrent.futures module. The examples in this chapter demonstrate how to work with coroutines, tasks, and thread/process pools to achieve concurrent execution in Python.
Key Concepts Covered

    Asyncio Coroutines:
        Demonstrates the use of coroutines to perform non-blocking tasks, such as calculating the sum of integers and factorials.
        Examples include simple coroutines, managing multiple coroutines, and yielding control to the event loop with asyncio.sleep().

    Finite State Machine Simulation:
        Implements a finite state machine using coroutines, where each state transitions based on random values. This example illustrates the power of asynchronous programming to handle state transitions.

    Task Scheduling:
        Introduces scheduling tasks with asyncio.call_later(), allowing for deferred execution of tasks in the event loop.

    Concurrent Execution:
        Uses the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor to parallelize tasks across multiple threads and processes. This section compares the performance of sequential, threaded, and multiprocessing execution.

    Factorial, Fibonacci, and Binomial Coefficients:
        Shows how to use coroutines to asynchronously compute mathematical functions such as factorial, Fibonacci, and binomial coefficients, demonstrating how to perform multiple calculations concurrently.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    asyncio (standard Python library)
    concurrent.futures (standard Python library)
