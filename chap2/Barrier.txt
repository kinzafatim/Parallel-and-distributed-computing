This program simulates a race using threads and a barrier to synchronize them:
    Imports:
        randrange generates random sleep times for runners (2-4 seconds).
        Barrier ensures all threads (runners) synchronize at a common point.
        Thread allows concurrent execution of the runner function.

    Variables:
        num_runners: Number of participants (3).
        runners: List of runner names.
        finish_line: Barrier that blocks until all runners reach it.

    runner Function: Each thread:
        Pops a runner's name.
        Simulates running (random sleep).
        Prints when the runner reaches the barrier.
        Waits for others at the barrier.

    main Function:
        Creates and starts threads for all runners.
        Waits for all threads to finish.
        Prints "Race over!" when done.
