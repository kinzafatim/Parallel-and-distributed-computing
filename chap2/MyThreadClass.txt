This program demonstrates multithreading in Python using the Thread class, where each thread performs a task and simulates a sleep duration.
Key Components:

    MyThreadClass:
        Inherits from Thread.
        The run() method is overridden to print the thread's start message, simulate work using time.sleep(), and print the end message.
        Each thread is given a random duration (between 1 and 10 seconds) for its sleep time.

    Main Function:
        Creates 9 threads, each with a unique name and random sleep duration.
        Starts all threads using start().
        Waits for all threads to finish using join().
        Prints the total execution time.
