This program solves the Producer-Consumer problem using multiprocessing:

    Queue: Shared between processes for data transfer.
    Producer: Adds 5 items (0 to 4) to the queue and logs them.
    Consumer: Retrieves and logs items from the queue until empty.
    Processes:
        p1: Runs the producer.
        p2: Runs the consumer.
    Flow: Both processes run concurrently, and the program waits for their completion.
