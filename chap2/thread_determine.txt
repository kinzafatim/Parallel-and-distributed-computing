Explanation:

    Function Definitions:
        Each function prints a "starting" message, sleeps for 2 seconds, and then prints an "exiting" message.

    Threads Creation:
        Three threads (t1, t2, t3) are created to execute function_A, function_B, and function_C concurrently.
        Each thread is named for clarity.

    Thread Execution:
        Each thread is started using .start() which triggers the execution of its target function.
        t1.join(), t2.join(), and t3.join() ensure the main thread waits for all threads to finish before terminating.
