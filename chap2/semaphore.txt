This program demonstrates the Producer-Consumer problem using a Semaphore for synchronization in multithreading.
Key Components

    Semaphore:
        semaphore: A Semaphore initialized with 0. It allows the producer to signal the consumer once an item is available.

    Consumer:
        Waits for the semaphore using semaphore.acquire() before consuming the item. Logs a message when notified.

    Producer:
        Waits for 3 seconds, generates a random item, and signals the consumer using semaphore.release().

    Main Function:
        Starts 10 producer-consumer pairs, where each pair is run as separate threads.

Flow:

    The producer generates an item and notifies the consumer using the semaphore. The consumer waits for the signal, consumes the item, and logs it.
