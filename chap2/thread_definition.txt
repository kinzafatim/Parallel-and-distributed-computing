Explanation:

    Function Definition (my_func):
        The my_func function takes a thread_number as an argument and prints a message indicating which thread called the function.

    Thread Creation and Execution:
        Inside the main() function, a loop runs 10 times, creating a new thread (t) for each iteration, passing the loop index (i) as an argument to my_func.
        The start() method starts each thread, and the join() method ensures that the main thread waits for the current thread to finish before starting the next one.

    Thread Behavior:
        start(): This initiates the execution of the thread.
        join(): This blocks the execution of the main thread until the current thread completes.
