Explanation:

    Function Definitions:
        print_square(num): Prints the square of a given number.
        print_cube(num): Prints the cube of a given number.

    Process Creation:
        Two processes (p1 and p2) are created to execute print_square and print_cube functions respectively, with 10 as the argument.

    Process Execution:
        p1.start() and p2.start() initiate the execution of both processes in parallel.
        p1.join() and p2.join() ensure that the main process waits for both p1 and p2 to complete before printing "Processes finished executing".
