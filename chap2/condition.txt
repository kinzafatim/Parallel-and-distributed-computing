Program Flow

    Producer starts producing items into the buffer every 0.5 seconds.
    Consumer starts consuming items from the buffer every 2 seconds.
    If the buffer is full, the producer waits until the consumer removes an item.
    If the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until the producer adds an item.
    The process continues for 20 iterations each.

Shared Resources:

    items: A list (buffer) with a max size of 10.
    condition: Manages thread synchronization between the producer and consumer.

Producer:

    Adds items to the buffer every 0.5 seconds.
    Waits if the buffer is full and notifies the consumer when an item is added.

Consumer:

    Removes items from the buffer every 2 seconds.
    Waits if the buffer is empty and notifies the producer when an item is consumed.

Synchronization:

    condition.wait(): Pauses the thread when it cannot proceed (e.g., buffer full/empty).
    condition.notify(): Wakes the other thread after producing/consuming.

Main Function:

    Starts and joins one producer and one consumer thread.
