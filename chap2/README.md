# Chapter 2:
    Focuses on synchronization, threading, multiprocessing, and interprocess communication (IPC). This chapter includes Python implementations and explanations of the following:
    - `Barrier.py`: Demonstrates barrier synchronization to ensure threads proceed together.
    - `MyThreadClass.py` / `MyThreadClassLock.py`: Explores threading basics and the use of locks to manage shared resources.
    - `RLock.py`: Covers the use of reentrant locks for thread-safe programming.
    - `Condition.py`: Explains how to use conditions for thread communication.
    - `Event.py`: Implements event-based synchronization.
    - `ProcessCreationAndManagement.py`: Introduces process creation and lifecycle management.
    - `SynchronizationPrimitive.py`: Provides examples of basic synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, and conditions.
    - `IPC.py` / `MPI.py`: Covers interprocess communication and the basics of message-passing interfaces.
