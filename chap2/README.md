# Chapter 2: Synchronization, Threading, Multiprocessing, and IPC

This chapter focuses on synchronization, threading, multiprocessing, and interprocess communication (IPC). This chapter includes Python implementations and explanations of the following:

## 1. **`Barrier.py`**  
- Demonstrates barrier synchronization to ensure threads proceed together.  
- Example Output:  
  ```plaintext
  All threads have reached the barrier.

2. MyThreadClass.py / MyThreadClassLock.py

    Explores threading basics and the use of locks to manage shared resources.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Thread 1 acquired lock.
    Thread 2 acquired lock.

3. RLock.py

    Covers the use of reentrant locks for thread-safe programming.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Thread 1 acquired reentrant lock.
    Thread 1 released reentrant lock.

4. Condition.py

    Explains how to use conditions for thread communication.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Condition met: Thread 1 signaling.

5. Event.py

    Implements event-based synchronization.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Event set, thread proceeding.

6. ProcessCreationAndManagement.py

    Introduces process creation and lifecycle management.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Process started with PID: 1234
    Process completed.

7. SynchronizationPrimitive.py

    Provides examples of basic synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, and conditions.
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Semaphore acquired by Thread 1.
    Condition variable waiting.

8. IPC.py / MPI.py

    Covers interprocess communication and the basics of message-passing interfaces (MPI).
    Example Output:
    ```plaintext
    Message sent to process 2.
    Process 2 received message.
