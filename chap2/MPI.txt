This program demonstrates message passing using mpi4py:

    Setup:
        rank: Process ID.
        size: Total number of processes.

    Logic:
        Requires at least 2 processes.
        Process 0 sends a dictionary to Process 1.
        Process 1 receives and prints the dictionary.
        Other processes remain idle.
