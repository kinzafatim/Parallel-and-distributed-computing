## üìú Chapters
  These folders contain exercises and programs from various chapters in my course. As the course progresses, new chapters will be added to reflect more advanced topics in parallel and distributed computing.
  - **Chapter 1: Multithreading Tasks**  
    This chapter focuses on foundational multithreading concepts and practical implementations using Python. It includes the following tasks:
    
    1. **Multiprocessing and Multithreading Performance Comparison:**  
       - Compares the execution time of processing a large dataset using Python's multiprocessing and threading modules.  
       - Implements `do_something` to distribute tasks across multiple processes or threads.  
       - Example Output:  
         ```plaintext
         List processing complete.
         Multiprocessing time = 1.23 seconds
         List processing complete.
         Multithreading time = 0.89 seconds
         ```

    2. **Fibonacci Calculation with Threads:**  
       - Spawns multiple threads to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.  
       - Demonstrates task parallelism using Python's `threading` module.  
       - Example Output:  
         ```plaintext
         Starting thread 1
         Starting thread 2
         Starting thread 3
         Total execution time: 3.56 seconds
         ```

    3. **Data Parallelism with NumPy:**  
       - Uses NumPy for efficient vector addition on large datasets.  
       - Leverages NumPy's internal parallelization for optimized computation.  
       - Example Output:  
         ```plaintext
         Time taken for data parallel computation (NumPy): 0.01234 seconds
         First 10 elements of result: [1.23, 2.34, 3.45, ...]
         ```

    4. **ThreadPoolExecutor for Task Scheduling:**  
       - Implements a task scheduler using Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.  
       - Schedules and executes multiple tasks concurrently.  
       - Example Output:  
         ```plaintext
         Task 1 executed
         Task 2 executed
         ```
