Function foo:
    Each process executes foo.
    Prints numbers based on process name ('background_process' or other).
    Sleeps for 1 second after the loop.

Process Creation:

    background_process is a daemon process (terminates when the main program finishes).
    NO_background_process is a non-daemon process (runs until completion).

Execution:  Both processes run concurrently.
    background_process prints 0-4 and exits.
    NO_background_process prints 5-9 and completes after the main program.

Daemon Process: background_process terminates as soon as the main program exits.

Non-Daemon Process:NO_background_process continues running until it finishes execution.
