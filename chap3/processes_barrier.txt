 Functions:
        test_with_barrier(synchronizer, serializer):
            Uses a Barrier to synchronize the two processes (p1 and p2), so they wait until both reach the barrier before proceeding.
            Uses a Lock (serializer) to ensure mutual exclusion when printing the timestamp.
        test_without_barrier():
            Prints the current timestamp without any synchronization, allowing processes to run independently.

Processes:
        test_with_barrier: Two processes (p1 and p2) are synchronized using the Barrier, meaning they will wait for each other to reach the barrier before printing the timestamp.
        test_without_barrier: Two independent processes (p3 and p4) print the timestamp without synchronization.

    Synchronization:
        Barrier(2): Ensures two processes wait for each other before proceeding.
        Lock(): Used to serialize access to the print statement, ensuring one process prints at a time.

    Execution:
        Processes are created using Process, then started with start().
        Since the Barrier is set for two processes, p1 and p2 will be synchronized, while p3 and p4 will run concurrently without any synchronization.

Output:  The processes p1 and p2 will print their timestamps at the same time after synchronizing at the barrier.
    The processes p3 and p4 will print independently, without waiting for each other.
