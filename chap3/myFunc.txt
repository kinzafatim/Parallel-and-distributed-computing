This Python function myFunc demonstrates a simple operation that prints messages based on the input value i.


    Parameters:
        i: An integer that determines:
            The process number (used in the message).
            The range of numbers to iterate through.

    Behavior:
        Prints the process number: 'calling myFunc from process nÂ°: %s' % i.
        Loops through numbers 0 to i-1 and prints: 'output from myFunc is :%s' % j.

    Return:
        Does not explicitly return a value (return is optional and could be omitted).
