This code demonstrates process lifecycle management using Python's multiprocessing module, including starting, terminating, and joining a process.
    Functionality: Demonstrates process lifecycle: start, terminate, and join.

    Process Lifecycle:
        Before Execution: Process created (is_alive() = False).
        Start: Process begins running (is_alive() = True).
        Terminate: Process forcibly stopped (is_alive() = False).
        Join: Ensures process cleanup before continuing.

    Exit Code:
        None: Process not exited yet.
        -15: Process was terminated.

    Output: Confirms process state at each step. Only part of foo executes before termination.
