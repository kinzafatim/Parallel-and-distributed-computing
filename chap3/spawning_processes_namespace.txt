Imports: multiprocessing: Used to create and manage processes.
        myFunc: A custom function (assumed to be defined elsewhere) that will be executed in parallel by each process.
 Main Execution:
        In the __main__ block, a loop runs 6 times (from 0 to 5).
        In each iteration:
            A new process is created using multiprocessing.Process.
            target=myFunc: Specifies the function to be executed.
            args=(i,): Passes the current iteration value (i) as an argument to myFunc.
            The process is started using process.start().
            The process.join() method ensures the main program waits for the process to complete before starting the next one.

Points: multiprocessing.Process: Creates a new process for each iteration.
    process.start(): Starts the process execution.
    process.join(): Ensures the main program waits for each process to finish before continuing to the next.
