    Function myFunc: Prints the current process's name.
        Sleeps for 3 seconds to simulate a task.
        Exits and prints the process name again.

    Processes:
        process_with_name:
            A custom-named process ('myFunc process').
        process_with_default_name:
            Uses the default process name (e.g., Process-1).

    Process Lifecycle:
        Both processes are started using start().
        join() ensures the main program waits for both processes to finish.

Output: The name of each process will be printed when they start and exit. The processes run concurrently.
